## 🚀 Installation & Setup  

### 1️⃣ **Install Dependencies**  

Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed. Then, install the required libraries:  

```sh
pip install streamlit scapy pandas
```

### 2️⃣ **Run the Application**  

Start the Streamlit app with:  

```sh
streamlit run packet_sniffer.py
```

### 3️⃣ **Grant Necessary Permissions**  

Since this tool captures network packets, **administrator/root access** is required:  

- **Windows:** Run **Command Prompt as Administrator**  
- **Linux/macOS:** Use `sudo` before running the script
